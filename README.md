# cmpe255 Fake Tweet Analysis

This project is an attempt to create several classifiers to classify false tweets from real tweets. The python notebook create_tweet_data is used to create the dataset.

## Getting a demo started

<p> In order to get a properly working demo, a sample dataset has been included in this repo. It is called <b>sample_dataset.csv</b>. Due to the 25MB file restriction in github, this dataset is only 5% of the true dataset, which contains over 3 million tuples.
</p>

### Step 1: Open the demo.ipynb file
### Step 2: change the path to the sample dataset in the read_csv method
### Step 3: Run all of the cells to view the CNN implementation
